This subdirectory is for images of the classroom to document the size, shape, etc.

The classroom is divided, from the point of view of the student, into:

* left (odd numbers 1,3,5,7,9,11), though not all rows go up to 11
* center (numbers 101-111), though not all rows go up to 111
* right (even numbers 2,4,6,8,10,12), though not all rows go up to 12
